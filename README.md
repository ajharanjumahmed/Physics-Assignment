# Physics-Assignment

This is a repository created for submitting the assignment assigned to me in the course "Physics - II". We were given two problems related
to our course content and were told to solve the problems by coding with any programming language. The questions for the problems are
given below:


Problem #1:
Consider you are conducting an experiment with a single slit diffraction experiment apparatus. The values of λ, m & a should be given as input. 
However, the program should ask for three values of "a" and calculate the respective values of the "theta's". The output of the program should print, 
which one of the slits bent the light more. The valid range for the wavelength should be from 380 nm to 750 nm. Out of this range for wavelength 
should give an output: “Out of the range. Please enter a valid number." 

- λ should be in nanometer(e^-9)
- d and a are in micrometer(e^-6)


Problem #2:
If a diffraction grating produces a third-order bright spot for green light (of wavelength 530 nm) 
at 65.0° from the central maximum, at what angle will the second-order bright spot be for red light (of wavelength 700 nm)?
